# Intrusion-Detection-System-using-Deep-Learning-Technique
Intrusion detection technology is one of the core components of dynamic security defence. Together with static security technologies, it may be used to build a strong network security system. IDS (Intrusion Detection System)â€™s main responsibilities are system protection, user behaviour analysis, and user behaviour prediction. Thus, these behaviours will either be perceived as an assault or as normal behaviour. Our major goal is to offer a comprehensive solution to identify intrusive attacks using deep learning techniques, which recognise new assaults using historical data gathered from proven attacks. In this paper, we deployed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), RNN-LSTM and Multilayer perceptron models to perform binary classification and multi-classification in order to detect the intrusion. The study also discusses preprocessing techniques, model comparisons, and evaluation techniques. we evaluated the performance of the developed models using various evaluation matrices (accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score). Finally, associated the outcomes of our proposed models to understand the best model for the network intrusion detection system.
